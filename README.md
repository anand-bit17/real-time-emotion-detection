# Real-Time Emotion Detection

This project provides a real-time emotion detection system using deep learning techniques. It analyzes live video streams or recorded video input and detects the predominant emotions expressed by human faces in the video frames. and for train this model we dataset FER-2013 from kaggle.

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: The system is capable of processing video streams in real-time, providing instantaneous feedback on the emotions detected.
- **Multiple Emotions**: Recognizes a range of emotions including happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and neutrality.
- **Accuracy**: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning models trained on large datasets to achieve high accuracy in emotion recognition.
- **Easy Integration**: Provides a simple and intuitive API for integrating the emotion detection system into other applications or projects.
- **Customizable**: Allows for customization of model parameters and thresholds to adapt to specific use cases or environments.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Supports multiple platforms including Linux, Windows, and macOS.

## Installation

To install the real-time emotion detection system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-emotion-detection.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Emotion Detection System

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd real-time-emotion-detection
   ```
2. Launch the real-time emotion detection system:
   ```
   gui.py
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to select the input source (e.g., webcam, video file) and start the emotion detection process.

## Examples

- **Example 1**: Detecting emotions in a live webcam stream.
